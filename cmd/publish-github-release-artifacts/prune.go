// Release-asset retention for publish-github-release-artifacts.
//
// Every publish uploads the full platform matrix (roughly 168 binaries, about
// 1.7 GB), and nothing in the publish path ever removed an older upload. One
// release a day therefore added ~1.7 GB per day forever, and the account
// carried over 100 GB of old binaries that no consumer downloads (the whole
// history had a few thousand downloads, against 13,000 stored assets).
// GitHub documents no cap on total release size, but its Acceptable Use Policy
// reserves the right to throttle file hosting for accounts that place undue
// strain on the infrastructure, so unbounded growth is a real risk.
//
// pruneReleaseAssets deletes the ASSETS of every release older than the newest
// --keep-releases releases that still have assets. It never deletes a release,
// and never deletes a git tag: the release page, its notes, and the tagged
// source all stay exactly as published, so proxy.golang.org / pkg.go.dev
// module checksums and changelog links are unaffected. Only the uploaded
// binaries go away.

//   - the secondary limit of 900 points/minute on REST endpoints, where a
//     mutative request (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE) costs 5 points, so about
//     180 deletions/minute.
//
// We pace just under the primary limit (75/minute, 4500/hour) so deletions flow
// steadily rather than bursting and then parking when the hourly budget runs
// out, and so the token keeps enough budget for anything else it does in the
// same hour. The one-time cleanup of ~11,600 assets therefore takes about
