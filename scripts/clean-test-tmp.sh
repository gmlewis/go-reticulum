# clean-test-tmp.sh — remove leftover test temp dirs/files from /tmp.
#
# The test suites create temp dirs via testutils.TempDir / TempDirMain, which
# register t.Cleanup / TestMain cleanup so a NORMAL run leaves nothing behind.
# The one historical deterministic leak — gorngit's group "<repoRoot>.allowed"
# sibling file written outside its TempDir — was fixed (it now registers an
# explicit t.Cleanup). Remaining /tmp garbage is therefore from KILLED runs
# (Ctrl-C, timeout, OOM, crash): when a test binary is killed, t.Cleanup never
# runs and its temp dirs stay in /tmp. This script reclaims that garbage.
#
# testutils also installs a SIGINT/SIGTERM handler that removes the dirs a run
# created before it exits (see testutils/cleanup.go), so an interrupted run no
# longer strands anything. This script is the backstop for what a handler
# cannot catch: SIGKILL, a `go test -timeout` panic, or os.Exit from an
# unrelated goroutine.
#
# Safety:
#   - Only removes entries whose name starts with one of the known TEST
#     prefixes below. It never touches unrelated /tmp content.
#   - Long-running user nodes (e.g. /tmp/gogit-manual, gonomadnet daemons) do
#     NOT match any of these prefixes and are never touched.
#   - A directory holding a .do-not-sweep file naming a LIVE PID is left alone
#     whatever its name. Tools that build under /tmp drop that marker in their
#     scratch dir, so a sweep cannot delete work in progress; a marker whose PID
#     is gone protects nothing, so a killed run's dir is still reclaimed.
#   - -n  dry run: list what would be removed, remove nothing.
#   - -m MINUTES  only remove entries older than MINUTES mtime (default: 0,
#     i.e. all). Use this to spare dirs from a currently-running test suite.
#   - -c  check: verify every temp-dir prefix the Go sources use is covered by
#     the list below, so it cannot rot silently. Removes nothing.
#   -L  live-safe: remove nothing while any test binary is running. Only
#     needed for an unguarded (-m 0) sweep, where there is no age guard to
#     spare the dirs a live run owns.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/clean-test-tmp.sh            # remove all test garbage
#   scripts/clean-test-tmp.sh -n         # dry run (list only)
#   scripts/clean-test-tmp.sh -m 30      # remove only entries > 30 min old
#   scripts/clean-test-tmp.sh -m 0 -L    # only when no test binary is running
#   scripts/clean-test-tmp.sh -c         # check the prefix list for drift

# Known TEST temp-dir/file prefixes from both repos' suites. This file is
# duplicated at ../go-nomadnet/scripts/clean-test-tmp.sh — keep the two copies
# IDENTICAL, because the repos share one /tmp and either suite's run should
# reclaim the other's residue too. `-c` verifies that this list covers the
# prefixes of whichever repo the copy lives in.
#
# NOTE: "gorrcbot-test-" is spelled out rather than shortened to "gorrcbot-",
# because an operator running the bot logs it to /tmp/gorrcbot-<epoch>.log and a
# bare prefix would delete a live service's log.
#
# NOTE: bare "gogit-" is intentionally NOT listed — the user's long-running
# manual node lives at /tmp/gogit-manual and must never be touched. Only the
# specific gogit-remote-rns test-suite prefixes are listed (none of them match
# gogit-manual). The same care applies to any bare prefix that could match a
# user process: list the specific test prefix, not the whole family. That is
# also why the loopback-/repeat-/probe- pairs below are listed by their full
# names rather than shortened to their common stem.
#
# NOTE: bare "gonomadnet-" and bare "gorns-" were both listed here once, and
# both deleted a live release build: they matched /tmp/gonomadnet-release-* and
# /tmp/gorns-release-*, the scratch dirs the release publishers build into. A
# concurrent test run's sweep removed those artifacts mid-publish, and because
# `go build -o` silently recreates a missing output directory, nothing failed
# until gh reported a missing asset. The families are now spelled out, and the
# dirs a tool owns are listed in not_swept_prefixes below, which -c enforces.

# Temp names `-c` recognizes but the sweep deliberately never touches. Two
# kinds live here:
#
#   - Created somewhere other than /tmp, so the sweep could not reach them even
#     if it tried: a server-side staging dir inside a repository's group
#     directory, and a Python subprocess's storage dir nested inside the test's
#     own temp dir (which removes it with its parent).
#
#   - Name FRAGMENTS appended to a caller's prefix, e.g.
#     TempDir(t, prefix+"initiator-"). The effective name always begins with
#     that caller's own prefix (gorngit-, gogit-remote-rns-), which IS swept
#     above; listing the fragment here just keeps -c from calling it new.
#
#   - Belonging to a long-running server rather than a test, so the sweep must
#     leave it alone even though -c sees the call site.
#
#   - A tool's own /tmp scratch or output path. These are a live run's working
#     state, not test residue: the release publishers build into
#     publish-release-<repo>-*, tooling/heap-dump.sh captures profiles into
#     gonomadnet-pprof-<ts>/, scripts/run-bench.sh tees results into
#     gonomadnet-bench-latest-<ts>.txt, tooling/sweep.sh builds
#     gonomadnet-sweep-bin, and a bench test writes gonomadnet-bench-config.
#     Listing them here is what keeps -c honest: a swept prefix that matched any
#     of them would make this script delete live state, and -c fails on exactly
#     that contradiction.
#
# "gobot-" is the gobot CLI's own scratch history directory. It is created with
# os.MkdirTemp("", ...), so it lives under $TMPDIR rather than /tmp, and a bare
# prefix is exactly the kind that could otherwise match a user's own /tmp file.
