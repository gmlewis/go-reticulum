# publish-github-release-artifacts.sh is a thin wrapper around the Go program
# cmd/publish-github-release-artifacts. It changes to the repo root and
# forwards all arguments (e.g. --force) verbatim so the Go program does the
# real work of building, checksumming, and publishing the GitHub release.
#
# The Go program's LAST step prunes release-asset storage: the assets of every
# release older than the newest 10 releases that still have assets are deleted.
# Releases, their notes, and their git tags are never deleted, so module
# checksums and changelog links stay valid.
#
# Publishing is resumable. The release is created as a draft and its artifacts
# uploaded to it one at a time, each retried with exponential backoff, and only
# then is the draft published — so a failure (GitHub's upload endpoint
# intermittently answers with "HTTP 500: Error saving asset") leaves an
# unpublished draft rather than a half-visible release. Re-run the same command
# to finish it: the draft is adopted, the artifacts already uploaded are not
# sent again, and the release is published. Nothing to clean up by hand.
#
# Usage:
#
#	./scripts/publish-github-release-artifacts.sh          # publish a new release
#	./scripts/publish-github-release-artifacts.sh --force  # replace an existing one
#
#	# Preview everything a publish would do, changing nothing remotely:
#	./scripts/publish-github-release-artifacts.sh --dry-run
#
#	# Fast preview (or real run) of the asset pruning alone, no build:
#	./scripts/publish-github-release-artifacts.sh --prune-only --dry-run
#	./scripts/publish-github-release-artifacts.sh --prune-only
#
#	# Change the retention window (default 10 releases):
#	./scripts/publish-github-release-artifacts.sh --keep-releases 20
#
# The prune is safe to interrupt: it recomputes its plan from live state on
# every run, so re-running --prune-only picks up where it left off.
